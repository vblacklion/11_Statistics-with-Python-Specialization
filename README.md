Statistics with Python (3 Course Specialization)
------------------------------------------------

About this Specialization

This specialization is designed to teach learners beginning and intermediate concepts of statistical analysis using the Python programming language. Learners will learn where data come from, what types of data can be collected, study data design, data management, and how to effectively carry out data exploration and visualization. They will be able to utilize data for estimation and assessing theories, construct confidence intervals, interpret inferential results, and apply more advanced statistical modeling procedures. Finally, they will learn the importance of and be able to connect research questions to the statistical and data analysis methods taught to them.


Some Take-Aways:
------------------------------------------------
It is always important to first ask what type of sampling mechanism was used to generate the data set that is presently under consideration. Then, if non-probability sampling methods were used, careful analyses of how representative that sample is with respect to the target population of interest are necessary before proceeding. 

*Standard Deviation of Sampling Distribution of the Proportion*
The standard deviation of sampling distribution of the proportion, P, is closely related to the binomial distribution. It’s a special case of a sampling distribution.

A sampling distribution is where you take a population (N), and find a statistic from that population. The “standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the proportion” means that in this case, you would calculate the standard deviation. This is repeated for all possible samples from the population.

Example: You hold a survey about college student’s GRE scores and calculate that the standard deviation is 1. It is highly unlikely that you will get the same results if you repeat the survey (you might get 1.1 ,1.2 or 0.9). Therefore you’ll want to repeat the poll the maximum number of times possible (i.e. you draw all possible samples of size n from the population). You’ll have a range of standard deviations — one for each sample. The probability distribution of all the standard deviations is a sampling distribution of the standard deviation.
