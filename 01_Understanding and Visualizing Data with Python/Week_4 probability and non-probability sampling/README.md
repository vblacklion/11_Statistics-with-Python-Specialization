Learning Objectives
------------------------------------

* Distinguish between probability and non-probability sampling
* Describe the concept of a sampling distribution, and how one can make inference about a population parameter based on the estimated features of that distribution
* Identify appropriate analytic techniques for probability and non-probability samples
* Explain how poorly-designed samples can lead to descriptions of population features that are biased in nature
